        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            This thesis defines an e-voting architecture based on blockchain technology. Within current decentralized
            blockchain e-voting implementations there are several problems under which poor privacy protection of voting
            behavior and inappropriate use of blockchain technology. These problems have led to a situation in which
            current blockchain e-voting systems actually are not any safer than centralized e-voting systems that do
            not use blockchain technology. Therefore, in this thesis, there will be described how e-voting processes can
            potentially be enhanced by applying blockchain technology in an appropriated manner. This is done by presenting
            an implementation- independent ’blueprint’ of a set of interrelated components, which is also called a
            (software) architecture. <br><br>

            First of all, in order to create an architecture, it is important to provide an in-depth analysis of the relevant
            domains which are in this case electoral processes, blockchain e-voting implementations and information security.
            This analysis revealed that each electoral process has its own set of flaws which resulted in a few companies that
            tried to solve these problems with blockchain. In order to better understand how these implementations work, the domain
            analysis also contains an in-depth analysis of how blockchain works. This analysis revealed that blockchain can potentially
            solve some serious problems which centralized solutions cannot solve such as precisely track actions, immutable data and
            prevent that a vote can be casted multiple times by a single voter. The domain analysis also revealed that the use of
            a blockchain that can only be altered by a single party is undesirable and eliminates almost all strengths of blockchain.
            Besides, the domain analysis also indicated that voting from the voters’ own device is undesirable since there cannot
            be guaranteed that the device does not contain malicious software. <br><br>

            The results of the domain analysis were used in order to create an architecture which tries to solve the problems in
            current e-voting implementations. This has led to a proposal which uses cryptographic techniques such as linkable ring
            signatures in order to preserve privacy on the blockchain. Moreover, by using public key cryptography there has also
            been researched how to prevent disclosure of voting behavior during election day. Together with these important factors,
            this architecture also contains practicalities like synchronization of nodes, the internal software structure of the
            voting booths, generating truly random numbers and more. <br><br>

            Although the proposed architecture is not used in an actual election yet, the proposal has been validated with help of
            experts in the domain of both e-voting and blockchain. This has led to a design which has acceptance of the experts
            in the domain but it still needs to be researched in a real situation whether security measures like linkable ring
            signatures really preserve privacy of the voting behavior.
